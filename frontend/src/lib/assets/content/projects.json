What about this show makes me revisit it over and over? Was it the wacky cold opens, dark humor, or clunky screenwriting? Then I realized it had to be the characters.<br><br>Each episode tells a different story, but what’s beautiful about this show is how character relationships transcend their circumstances and challenges. How Jake and Amy navigate their relationship despite all the hurdles or how Gina and Captain Holt develop an unlikely friendship, Brooklyn Nine-Nine’s character relationships make the precinct feel like a real, albeit dysfunctional, family—like life itself.<br><br>In the spirit of the Jimmy Jab Games, I set out to find the most iconic duo in Brooklyn Nine-Nine. Which character duo is most beloved by the viewers, without whom Brooklyn Nine-Nine would not be the same?",

Mind maps help me visualize my thoughts, so I started there.<br><br>After many questions and thought spirals, I measured iconicness with popularity. On IMDb, every Brooklyn Nine-Nine episode's rating is calculated as the average of ratings received from a certain number of votes. Using this metric, I can assign the episode's rating to each character pair/group in that episode.<br><br>For instance, if Jake and Amy are paired in an episode with an average rating of 8.9/10, I could assume their duo was partially responsible for this rating. This helps me compare the ratings of different pairs/groups throughout the show.",

I chose to assign the episode’s rating to each character group to measure its popularity with the audience (since it changes with every episode). The question now is: How can I identify the episode’s different character groups?<br><br>The key was through a language analysis. For every episode, Brooklyn Nine–Nine’s production company released an “official” episode description– a short one-paragraph description of the episode’s storylines. By analyzing episode descriptions, I could identify which characters were grouped and correspond these findings with the episode rating. Once the analysis was complete for every episode, I could compare the average rating of character groups in all episodes to narrow down the most “iconic” or popular duo.",
