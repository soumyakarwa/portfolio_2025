In today’s attention economy, I believe the strongest way to tell stories and build trust is through direct, transparent communication, showing the data behind the narrative.<br><br>My work explores the intersection of data, design, and code, pushing the boundaries of what these tools can create together. I’m always excited to chat about this space (and more things like the <b>right</b> way to make an iced latte) so please reach out at <a href='mailto:soumyakarwa01@gmail.com'>soumyakarwa01@gmail.com</a>.",
